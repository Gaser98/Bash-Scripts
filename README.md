# Bash-Scripts
A repo for essential bash scripts that I created on the job to automate tedious tasks.

### setup-passwordless-ssh.sh
Bootstraps password-less SSH access from a control node to multiple servers using their respective users which facilitates login later.
sshpass is mandatory to utilize this script.
